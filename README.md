## Planning
To wire frame this project i used pen and paper and sketched out my design.


## Build
My idea was to start small with this project, then add extra features such as levels once the MVP had been met. 

For this game, the MVP was to be able to show a selection of images and when a correct matching pair is clicked an event would occur, in this instance a point scored.

Once this had been reached I then implemented styling, a scoreboard counter and audio.


## Challenges
My first big challenge was to create a function that would cycle through the selection of images in random order on an interval timer showing one at a time.

Once I had this in place my second challenge was to have a function that could identify when a player had made a correct pair of images. In the example, it was my “handleResults” and “handleWhichResults” functions that achieved this.

When creating level 2 I had the challenge of removing the previous images from the game when clicking on the new level button.

A more detailed view on how I overcame the challenges.


## Future Developments
* In the future I would like to increase the number of levels within the game. With this, it would allow me to add additional features.

* I would like to re-style the game.

## Game Instructions

Click the Start Game button - As the images appear click on the correct matching pair. For every correct pair made a point is scored.

Level 2 - The speed at which the images are shown is increased and any incorrect pairs made you will lose points.
